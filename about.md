# Martí
My name is Martí, and I am from Barcelona, Spain. I spent two years in Hong Kong completing the International Baccalaureate at United World College, and I am now pursuing a major in Economics and Business with a minor in Chinese in the United States. Living in such diverse parts of the world has given me a global perspective and strengthened my adaptability and cross-cultural understanding.
